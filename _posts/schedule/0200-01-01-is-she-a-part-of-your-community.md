OSM is a global community and yet not as diverse in the gender aspect. Though considerable effort has gone into introducing more women to OpenStreetMap, the transformation of newcomers into long standing contributors to the community doesn't happen automatically. There seems to be need for dedicated efforts to help novice women gain their foothold in the domain. Based on my efforts and experiments to increase women participation in my local community, this talk proposes three specific guidelines as a first step for communities to provide a congenial environment for women to be active participants. While on the topic of blurring gender lines, the talk also touches upon the importance of participation from all genders and not just women. The aim is not just to promote and increase participation of women but evolve as a truly open and diverse community with participants from all and any gender.
