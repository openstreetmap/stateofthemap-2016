In 2013, the buildings from the Brussels local government database were incorporated into OSM. The local government databases are updated every three months. However since 2013, there is still no process to integrate theses changes into OSM. Having such a process would be beneficial for OSM but also for local government as sometimes OSM is more up to date than their data. We are investigating a process to compare theses two databases. Currently, our method uses the Hausdorff distance to detect the differences on the building shapes [http://blog.champs-libres.coop/carto/2015/12/01/comparaison-urbis-osm.html] We are working on the automation of this method and exploring tools like osmose.openstreetmap.fr that helps the mappers to keep the buildings up to date.
