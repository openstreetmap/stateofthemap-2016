Pathways, biking routes, field roads or shortcuts: these are everyday spots and trajectories whom we rarely contemplate on. Yet what we consider self-evident, stays often invisible. Trage Wegen (literally: ‘association for Slow Roads’) is an organization that pinpoints, strives for and most importantly wants to celebrate these hidden gems, suitable for pedestrians and bikers.

Trage Wegen has been carrying out projects for the Brussels government since 2013. Their joint focus lies in catering for pedestrians in Brussels, on making the walking-experience in the capital more pleasant and easy. For these projects, we worked with OSM-data to be able to take stock of different types of pathways and points of interest. It has helped us a great deal in fulfilling the project-goals.

During the talk, we want to unravel our methodology of working with OSM-data for the projects we have executed and currently carry out in the Brussels region. We also want to stress how much we believe in and want to support the open-data model as a way of unlocking information for all and instigating change and resourcefulness. We both extract from OSM as well as give input.

This session is actually a big thank you to the OSM-community. As an organization that makes non-stop use of OSM-data we are the living proof that OSM is incredibly relevant and necessary to make exciting things happen.

The talk can be held in English.
