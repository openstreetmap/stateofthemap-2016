Lists.openstreetmap.org  is the home of more than 150 international mailing lists and in Germany we count more than 50 regional mailing lists. More information are produced in forums, blogs, Twitter and other social media.
It is not possible for an interested mapper to be informed on what is going on in the global community. In order to fill this gap Wochennotiz/weeklyOSM was created.
weeklyOSM will be the way to spread the important news in OSM world but the needs of every community integrated to it as well.
weeklyOSM tries to offer a way for publish all the projects and application developed for people who are passionate about OSM.
Weâ€™ll like to share our experiences in the process of making the weeklyOSM every week for every language involve (German, Spanish, English, Japanese, Czech), how we do it, how we proceed to collect every news and choose them and impact on the osm community globally as well.
We have in mind to offer a workshop as well for journalistic interessed people who will help to informe communities in other languages as we offer until now.
