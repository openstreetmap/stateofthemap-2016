In 2013, we did a spontaneous 1 day OSM training for a very eager lecturer & his 15 students in Makassar, biggest city in East Indonesia that is very prone to flooding. Unexpectedly, the data exploded in just a few weeks as they taught OSM to more students afterwards and mapped the entire city. From just few hundreds buildings it became the top 20 most OSM densely mapped area in 2013 (900k buildings mapped until now). The city govt then used the data to create an accurate flood contingency planning. Learning from this, last year we developed & implemented the method to 13universities & certified more than 50students as champions/trainers in their provinces, 5 universities have incorporated OSM into their curriculum, and students from a university took the initiative to help the govt mapping their region during a volcano eruption. This year we continue the program with more universities as we try to build partnership between universities, disaster research centers, & disaster management agencies
