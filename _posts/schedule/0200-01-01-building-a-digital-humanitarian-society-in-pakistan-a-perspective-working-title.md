Crowdsourced mapping in Pakistan is difficult now. The bill India recently published to control the geospatial information, Pakistan did something similar back in 2013. There's a ban on unauthorized mapping and this has put a dent in crowdsourced mapping in Pakistan. Unfortunately, unlike in India's case, it's not really obvious to the Pakistan community or the rest of the world, that this is not a small thing. In such circumstances, I am trying to create a digital humanitarian society in Pakistan by teaching OSM to the new generations of digital humanitarians. My story will offer my perspective, my 10 years of experience working under difficult circumstances and with unique challenges, why this is important to us, what are we going to do and how can we participate in the global humanitarian activities until Pakistan lets us or asks us to help Pakistan. I expect to inform the policy makers at all levels to share the perspective from the Pakistan community over a long history.
