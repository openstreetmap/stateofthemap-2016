Today OpenStreetMap has 188 M buildings tagged.

This is an awesome number! But majority has not much more than a footprint geometry available.

For spatial orientation, navigation, solar potential analysis, risk detection and others there is a demand for more specific tagging.

For a larger audience it's inconvenient to use a fully featured OSM editor or to deal with geometry aspects.

"Brick" (Working title) offers a minimalistic set of editable attributes, i.e. height, color, building purpose, roof type.
It runs as a mobile web application and thus is available to everyone without installation and ready for instant editing.

Thanks to OSM API and an OSM Buildings viewer, results are visible immediately.

In my talk, I'll guide you through the editor. It'll be be a short tour as it is simple to use. I'll also discuss the technical aspects.

I'd like you to use it during the session and looking forward for your feedback.
