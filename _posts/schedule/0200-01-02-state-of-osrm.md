The Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) is a popular routing engine, providing blazing fast global route-finding on OpenStreetMap. In the last 12 months, OSRM has taken big-steps towards a world-class navigation experience for car drivers: We made route duration estimates more realistic, by allowing developers to provide custom speed and turn duration data. We also dramatically shortened pre-processing times and improved turn-by-turn guidance.

In this talk we will explain these new features, highlight trade-offs we faced, and discuss the nitty-gritty of doing navigation on OpenStreetMap.
