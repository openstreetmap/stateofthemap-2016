The Red Cross just started a project for camp-mapping in Greece. Primarily for the migrant camp where we (the Red Cross) are active, but it might get expanded to other camps in Greece as well. The project entails that we are doing some basic infrastructure mapping of the various camps (based on recent aerial imagery). With that we will work together with migrants in the camps to further enrich the map, to get a detailed map of all relevant information. These maps will be used for interaction of parties active in the camps to engage with the people living there. And of course, can also be used by migrants amongst each other.Realizing the approach being similar to what Mapfugees have done in Calais, we are now in contact with each other to further work on the implementation of the mapping-by-migrants phase. The presentation will cover (amongst others) why we started this project, how we have set it up, how we are using the map in our work.
