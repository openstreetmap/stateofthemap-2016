In early 2016, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) made a commitment to the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data. As part of this process, HOT mapped the work of the global OSM community to the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. Incredibly, (or perhaps not so surprisingly), it was found that the global OSM community is contributing to nearly all of the goals – from measuring financial inclusion in Uganda (Goal 1 – No Poverty), to providing vocational training, decent jobs, and entrepreneurship opportunities (Goal 4 – Quality Education), to mapping the number of households, housing conditions and access to basic services in informal settlements in Dar es Salaam Tanzania (Goal 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities). OpenStreetMap is front and center in each of these projects; contributing directly to several of the goals, enable data-driven decision making, and allowing real-time monitoring and evaluation of SDG progress. This talk aims to raise awareness of the many ways that OSM data, and also the process by which it is generated, are contributing to a more equitable world.
