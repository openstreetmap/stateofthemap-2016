Although vector tile servers are all the rage, creating a simple tile server for raster is already the first step to host your own custom tiles. We will review using Tilestache how to do it. We will provide your the step to install the server, load a simple OSM project and then play with styles. We will see also show how to consume vector tiles as sources for server raster tiles.
