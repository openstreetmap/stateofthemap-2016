OSM data represent a "static" world and is not designed to share time related data. As an example, we can do route calculations but they cannot take into account traffic jams, closed roads or road work.
OpenEventDatabase's goal is to provide an open platform to share "events" which are data with "what", "where" and "when" details.
An open API is available since may 2016, the project is available on https://github.com/openeventdatabase
The current content is currently (may 2016) fed with weather warning and alerts and motorway traffic informations.
