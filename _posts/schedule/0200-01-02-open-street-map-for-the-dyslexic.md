OSM for the dyslexic is a GIS application for Android to make OpenStreetMap accessible by dyslexics, mitigating common reading errors.

The concept of styling maps for dislexics is an innovative point of view for increasing acessibility of the GIS (open) data.

The session will be on the thechnology used, on the application itself and on the lession learned while developing it: how to map for a dyslexic user.
