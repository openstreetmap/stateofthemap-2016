TeachOSM is dedicated to making OpenStreetMap the on-ramp to a rich world of open source mapping tools and educational activities. Geography education is lacking in many corners of the world. We believe OSM and other open source geospatial tools can be used to teach the fundamental concepts of geography and mapping to all age levels. This talk will feature experiences and lessons learned during TeachOSM professional and youth workshops in the Caribbean and Mauritius. Workshops focused on the use of OpenStreetMap, open data, and QGIS to strengthen economies and build accurate maps of the local communities. During this talk, I will share these experiences, discuss the TeachOSM vision, and solicit ideas from the packed room of attendees. Join me and find out how TeachOSM can make OpenStreetMap the platform to revolutionize & open source geography education!
