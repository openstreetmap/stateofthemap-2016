- How can we use community mapping as an effective method to increase resilience to natural hazards and the impacts of climate change?
- What does make a community mapping project successful?
- What are the strategies for engaging local stakeholders and creating cross-organizations communities?
- How can we measure sustainability of a local OpenStreetMap community?

This talk will address these open questions by presenting core principles of engagement and best practices to design successful community mapping activities. These will be illustrated by examples from Malawi, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Tanzania where the support to the growth of the local OSM community since 2012 have proved to be invaluable for disaster response, recovery and urban resilience.

These best practices and examples draw on experiences of the Open Data for Resilience Initiative (OpenDRI) from the World Bankâ€™s Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) and local and international partners who have been engaging in community mapping projects that facilitate data-driven approaches to urban planning and disaster risk management. Since its inception in 2011, OpenDRI has brought together stakeholders from governments, donor agencies, the private sector, universities and civil society groups to create usable information through community mapping techniques using OpenStreetMap, to build applications and tools to inform decision-making, and to develop networks of trust necessary for these efforts to become sustainable.
