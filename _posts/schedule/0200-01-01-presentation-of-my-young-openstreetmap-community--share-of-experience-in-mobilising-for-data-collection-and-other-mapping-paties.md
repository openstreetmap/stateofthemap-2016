My session is about presentation of my young community, its goals, challenges, achievements and expectations. I'll share my experiences, as a women in a male-dominated environment, in mobilising members for Data collection and edition in the openstreetmap database or other mapping parties. This session is an opportunity for me to let the entire world know how it's difficult for a women to be part or to lead an openstreetmap team, which lots of African think it's a male rule.Despite all those negative thoughts against women, i don't give up and decided to go forward with the support other women from every areas.
