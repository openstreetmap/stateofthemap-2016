Open Schools Kenya (www.openschoolskenya.org) is a project supported by Gates Foundation and implemented by Map Kibera Trust to try and make education information easily available, accessible and useful to everyone, focusing on Kibera as a pilot site.

The project has seen around 350 schools mapped in Kibera including informal, private and public schools. The project aims to help parents make informed choices on which schools to take their children to depending on their capabilities and also preferences.

The government now have the data for all the schools in Kibera and can use it for proper planning around education.  NGOs and donors can also use the website to fund or implement other educational programs in the area. The website gives each and every school  a profile page with details ranging from the population, programs offered, fees, contact info etc.

We collected all the data with the use of gps and then edited the data using JOSM and uploaded it on OSM. Later we build the site and used the map on OSM as the base map and over layed the school data on top of it.
