With a global community of over 2.5 million registered users and a planet reaching the 50GB file size, making sense of OSM data, globally, locally, and temporally, presents significant challenges. In 2016 an online platform which could filter by user, timeslider, custom drawn areas and more was born.

Built by the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, with support by key partners, the application relies on daily preprocessing routines of OSM QA Tiles and data aggregation into vector tiles. By making OSM data facts easily accessible through an intuitive user interface, OSM-Analytics.org wants to become the go-to place for tracking progress on community mapping projects, assessing map coverage, and telling data-rich map stories. Cristiano explains all.
