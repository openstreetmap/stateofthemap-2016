With a global community of over 2.5 million registered users and a planet reaching the 50GB file size, OSM is officially entering the big data league. Making sense of this much data, globally, locally, and temporally, presents significant challenges.

In 2016 the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team with support by key partners, built an online platform for real time analysis of OSM data. The application relies on daily preprocessing routines of OSM QA Tiles and data aggregation into vector tiles. Results are displayed on a Web map and dynamically filtered based on user defined areas and a time slider selector. Other analytical functions include displaying map features based on OSM contribution level of experience and recency of edits. Every function is available at any scale, from the entire planet, down to small villages and individual buildings.

By making OSM data facts easily accessible through an intuitive user interface, OSM-Analytics.org wants to become the go-to place for tracking progress on community mapping projects, assessing map coverage, and telling data-rich map stories.
