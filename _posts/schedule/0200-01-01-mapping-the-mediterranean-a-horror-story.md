Everybody loves OSM. Yet, the mindset it was created with are very deeply anglo-centric and some simplifications are very deeply bound to an anglo-saxon world. A world in which space was always enough, historical layers are not that deeply connected to the modern cities. For this reason, sometimes the editing tools fall short, if we want to represent the complex mediterranean world. In this session we will present some extreme cases of complexity and cases of hacks in some mediterranean cities and the takeaways from our experience.
