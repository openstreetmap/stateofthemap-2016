This talk explains why so-called "mechanical edits" - edits in which the mapper changes a larger number of objects without looking at them individually, or edits in which the mapper is a computer program - can be detrimental to OpenStreetMap. It outlines the frequent pitfalls waiting for those who attempt mechanical edits, and explains the correct procedures for performing them.
