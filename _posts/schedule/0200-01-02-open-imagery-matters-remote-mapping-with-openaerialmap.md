Remote mapping in OpenStreetMap requires access to openly licensed imagery. Since last summer's launch, OpenAerialMap is providing completely open access to drone and aerial imagery around the world with immediate use in OpenStreetMap. Anyone around the world can now find and access open image data and contribute to OSM using high-resolution imagery.

The OAM community is made of satellite companies and drone operators that are adding new imagery and growing the set of open source tools to access and analyze the data. Users can search through a web-based map browser, connect to an API, and upload imagery to publish open imagery. Imagery can be immediately loaded into iD or JOSM for tracing in OpenStreetMap.

This talk will walk through the core components of the OpenAerialMap system and how users can quickly upload and share imagery that can be used directly with OpenStreetMap. The OAM community is planning for more growth over the next year and anyone can get involved. We will also share the results of the growth of the community of tools over the last year and share further plans for how imagery within OAM can be integrated with OSM.
