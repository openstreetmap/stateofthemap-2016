Indoor maps are the next big thing. All big map players have started experimenting in last few years, and it has also been a natural challenge for OSM. Can we propose a simple yet powerful tagging? There is already a lot of effort invested. Now I challenged the topic in my thesis and would like to share the outcomes, along with editor implementation and other tools.
