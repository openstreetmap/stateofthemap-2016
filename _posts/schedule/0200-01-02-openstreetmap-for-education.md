I work a lot on how we can use OpenStreetMap with children in many ways for many objectives (knowing our daily environment, talking about commons, sharing our knowledge...). We also have experience of work with youth workers in social center, etc. We would like to share our initiatives, our experiences to spread OSM in direction of youngs in the world. I can do it in English or french.
