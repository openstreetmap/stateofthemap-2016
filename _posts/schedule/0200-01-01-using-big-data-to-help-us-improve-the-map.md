Drivers using Telenav's OpenStreetMap based Scout applications generate a continuous stream of location information. Liquid gold as it turns out! Using sophisticated matching and generalization techniques, Telenav's OSM engineers create something beautiful out of those billions of raw data points. We call it Improve OSM. A suite of tools that give mappers small but satisfying mapping tasks for contributing to OpenStreetMap in a meaningful way. In this talk, one of our lead OSM engineers will dig beneath the surface to reveal some of the elaborate data processing and the technology stack we built to make all this possible.

What you have seen thus far is merely the beginning of Improve OSM. We have some exciting improvements planned, so we hope to leave some time to talk about the future of Improve OSM.

If you are interested in how to apply Big Data concepts to OpenStreetMap to gain high-value intelligence for improving the map, this is a talk you do not want to miss. Also watch out for a lightning talk about the user-facing parts of Improve OSM - the JOSM plugin and web site.
