Railway mapping is a topic most mappers either do not know much about or do not want to know much about. It is a rather exotic topic but it has its fans.

OpenRailwayMap is a map of the  railway infrastructure (tracks, signals, speed limits, electrification) and well-know by lots of railway fans. In difference to other special-interest maps, OpenRailwayMap is quite country-dependend because railway signalling differs between countries very much.

This talk will present mapping and tagging of railway-specific data, how good railway-specific data currently is and which help is needed to port OpenRailwayMap to more countries. OpenRailwayMap is quite country-dependend because railway signalling differs very much between countries. OpenRailwayMap currently only supports railway signals of Germany, Austria and Finnland.
