Many public transit route planning interfaces exist for public transit route planning as open source, as a software as a service, or as end-user applications. GTFS has become the de facto standard for exchanging public transit timetables, yet the glue between these GTFS files (for example providing tranfer times and footpaths) is a map layer such as Open Street Map.

The workshop will be organised by members of the Open Transport working group at Open Knowledge International, to discuss the state of the art and the next steps within public transit route planning.
