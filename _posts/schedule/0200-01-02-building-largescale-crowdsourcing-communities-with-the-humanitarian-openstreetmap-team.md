Since its inception in 2010, the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) has coordinated thousands of volunteers in the creation of maps for humanitarian purposes. Contributors have traced satellite images and digitised field data in response to Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, the Nepal earthquake in 2015, the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, and other disasters where aid teams require updated maps to coordinate their work. Despite these efforts, large parts of the world remain unmapped. In order to tackle the vast scale of their ambitions, HOT is now trying to understand how to grow one of the largest crowdsourcing communities on the planet.

My research is focused on this growth challenge: I seek to develop a better understanding of how to recruit and retain an active contributor community. The initial contributor experience can play an important role in this, particularly when contributions require some expertise. The research involves large-scale quantitative studies based on the contribution history of thousands of participants. I also spend much time with the community to better understand their practices and their concerns. I frequently share my findings with the community, and the ensuing discussions with practitioners have shaped my research in important ways.
