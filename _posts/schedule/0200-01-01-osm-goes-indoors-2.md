The French community mapped with great details more than 400 train stations in Paris and over a large area around. Why did the French railway company SNCF supported this project? How OSM became the main database to create maps for travelers' information in this company? SNCF Transilien's Chief Digital Officer will share its strategy of co-contribution with the community.
