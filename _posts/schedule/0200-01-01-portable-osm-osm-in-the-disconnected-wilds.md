OpenStreetMap is amazing. Many of the offline tools are amazing. However, for intensive mapping by small teams, the existing tools fall short and make editing and contributing to OSM difficult. This is especially true in remote communities and parts of the developing world that lack reliable internet connectivity. Because the Red Crossâ€™ mapping locations are so remote, we needed a better way to interact and edit OSM in a disconnected way for days and potentially weeks at a time.

Portable OSM (POSM) combines an offline OSM API, Field Papers, OpenMapKit, a captive portal, and many new enhancements to the OSM workflow. POSM runs on very cheap hardware (<$300), with the goal of enabling it to run on small embeddable devices such as a Raspberry Pi. Users are able to download an area of interest, easily configure the portable server, work offline in the field (using OpenMapKit, iD, and JOSM to edit OSM), and then return to a connected environment and sync all changes back to OpenStreetMap.

POSM was built by an all-star team from SpatialDev and Stamen Designs, leverages many existing FOSS projects, and creates new ones. Portable OSM was field tested in Ecuador, the desert of Columbia, and the jungles of West Africa. This session will take you through the design and architecture process, our experience using POSM in real world conditions and show you how to set up your own Portable OSM instance.
