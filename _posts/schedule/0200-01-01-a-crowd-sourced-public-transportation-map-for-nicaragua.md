There has been no map for the forty-five bus lines in Metropolitan Managua, where around 1.5 million inhabitants are dependent on buses to commute to work or school. But engaged citizens used Free Technology and the power of collaboration to create the first complete public transportation map of a Central American capital, by using OpenStreetMap and through crowd-sourcing and also crowd-funding methods.

We present the final products and talk about the publication of our outcomes as Open Data. We will also mention the local challenges and the nature of creating a map of informal transit information of a partially unregulated bus network.

It is a case study about Open Geo Software can empower people and enhance development, in places where, like in grand parts of the world, information about transportation is lacking.
