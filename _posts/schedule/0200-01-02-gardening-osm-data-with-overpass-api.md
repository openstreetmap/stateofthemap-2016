The review of the data by the community is an often cited advantage of OSM. Nonetheless, it is still diffcult to make sense of whole changesets or to trace back changes to the user who has done the changes. In this talk, it is shown how the existing tools can be used together and it is shown a new approach to trace back automatically the origin of each individual tag with Overpass API. We will finally use the tools to figure out whether there are a relevant number of edit wars in OSM.
