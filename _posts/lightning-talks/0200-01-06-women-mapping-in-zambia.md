OpenStreetMap Zambia started in 2015. One of the first activities, was developing a concept to train women with the intention of mapping map health facilities that are of importance to them and their children in the low income areas of Lusaka. After discussing the idea with the German Development Cooperation (GIZ) and the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), we further focused on water supply and sanitation infrastructure, and solid waste disposal.  GIZ and MCA  sponsored a kick-off event on International Women’s Day (8th March, 2016) , where mapping was officially launched in Mtendere Compound with the support of the Ministry of Local Government and Housing and Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company. Fifty women in the community expressed their willingness to support the project through mapping the neighborhood.

Mapping objectives: First the mapping serves as a means to sensitize the community in managing the waste and sanitation facilities. This is of high importance for the development of the communities for the reduction of diseases like diarrhea, cholera. Secondly the data is needed as baseline information for a planned upgrading of parts of the city’s sanitation infrastructure. With major investments in this field, OpenStreetMap data can serve to monitor change in the city’s development.
