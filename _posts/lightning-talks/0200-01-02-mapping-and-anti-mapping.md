A techie and a teacher, I work with a group called the Seattle Privacy Coalition. We advocate transparency for institutions and privacy for individuals. As privacy activists, we know that our struggle is about the control of information -- who owns it, who takes it by stealth or force or cash, who keeps it hidden, who exposes it. I know next to nothing about cartography, but when I first understood that OpenStreetMap is fundamentally a database, I knew that I was on familiar ground. Seattle Privacy's first act was to map the surveillance cameras that overnight dotted our waterfront. Our most recent adventure involved being raided by police looking for a node in the Tor network, a communication system meant to erase geography.

Mapping is power. The ability to map, or to stay off a map, is a contested space of freedom when governments and businesses expend vast resources to know our every movement, and in whose company we move -- the cell-phone breadcrumb trail, the social graph. Intelligence agencies call this ""metadata,"" more useful even than data itself. We call it mapping -- of objects and places, but also of patterns and relationships.

This talk recounts our experience of mapping (offensive, defensive), and the defeat of mapping, as tactics to expand personal and collective freedom.
