Vector tiles brought whole new possibility of digital fabrication with the map. I have been experimenting 3D prints with vector tiles(https://hanbyul-here.github.io/tile-exporter), SVG exports of the tiles. (https://github.com/hanbyul-here/svg-exporter-cli) . I'd love to share my experiments and show how people can use this in creative way.
